    <h1> <span>The day when fate changed</span> </h1>
    <h2>On May 30th, the U-20 World Cup happened to change his destiny.</h2>
    <h2>After scoring the first goal in the 7th minute of the first half, he scored the second goal in the 20th minute. After that, he scored 4 goals with only PK, a dynamic left foot bullet and the first half.</h2>
    <h2>In the second half, the momentum increased and he earned 5 points by playing the opponent's goalkeeper's hand and shaking the net. He scored a total of 9 goals and led to a big win of 12-0, which is the largest score difference in the history of the tournament.</h2>
    <h2>FIFA official Twitter praised all the goal scenes, saying, "I have never seen a hat-trick (9 goals per game) at the U-20 World Cup. It's Erling Haaland, everyone."</h2>
    <h2>Harland, an 18-year-old unnamed player, quickly spread his name to the world.</h2>
